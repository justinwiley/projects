       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The `test` function defines a test case named `test`.\n",
       "2. Inside the `test` function, we initialize two variables: `result` to `False` and `message` to an empty string.\n",
       "3. We then execute the code we want to test by calling `some_function`.\n",
       "4. We check the `result` and `message` after the function execution and update the `message` variable accordingly.\n",
       "5. Finally, we return the `result` and `message` as a tuple and call the `test` function.\n",
       "6. In the main part of the code, we call the `test` function and print the result and message.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Output:**\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "Result: True\n",
       "Message: The function worked as expected.\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "**Note:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Replace `some_function` with the actual function you want to test.\n",
       "* You can modify the `test` function to perform different tests with different inputs.\n",
       "* The `end_of_turn` function is not defined in this example, but it is used in the `test` function to signal the end of the test execution.</span>\n",
