INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT

**OLIVIA:** *(to ELEANOR)* Eleanor, I heard about your encounter with Charles. It's terrible that he treats you like that. You deserve so much more than that.

**ELEANOR:** You know, Olivia, I can see why he would be drawn to me. He's handsome and charming, but he's also kind and thoughtful. I'd never intentionally hurt him.

**OLIVIA:** But it's not just about that, Eleanor. It's about the way he treats our parents. It's about the unspoken tension between him and them. I can feel it in the air.

**ELEANOR:** I understand your concerns, Olivia. But I can assure you, I wouldn't intentionally harm Charles. He's a good friend, and I would never do anything to jeopardize our family's reputation.

EXT. MANOR GROUNDS - NIGHT

*Olivia paces the corridors, the flickering candlelight casting shadows on her face. Suddenly, a stranger, EDWARD, appears at the gates.*

**EDWARD:** I have come to gather information about the manor and its inhabitants. I have heard whispers of a tragic event that occurred years ago, and I believe I can help shed some light on it.

**OLIVIA:** Edward, what are you doing here?

**EDWARD:** I want to know the truth about my parents' past. I believe that Olivia witnessed something that she shouldn't have, and I want to know the details.

**OLIVIA:** I'm not sure what you want. I want to know the truth, but I can't trust you completely.

**EDWARD:** I assure you, I am not here to harm you. I'm here to help.
